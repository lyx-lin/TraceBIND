# TraceBIND
## Overview
The identification of footprints provides a powerful means to detect base-pair resolution signals of regulatory elements in chromatin accessibility data. We observe substantial variability in Tn5 transposase cleavage bias across individual samples, highlighting the need for sample-specific correction. TraceBIND is a R package that that corrects sample-specific Tn5 bias through mitochondria-based fine-tuning of PRINTâ€™s deep learning model, and use it to identify TF and nucleosome footprints through a dynamic flanking window statistical scan. TraceBIND also enables sample-specific FDR-controlled p-value thresholds stratified by varying coverage, which is necessary because coverage can vary across orders of magnitude in ATAC-seq data.
